# COVID-19-Analysis
This was created in PostgreSQL and analyzes various COVID-19 metrics. The data was pulled from ourworldindata.org.
The two source filesare CovidDeaths.csv and CovidVaccinations.csv. 
I imported them into postgreSQL by first creating the tables, then using the COPY function to load in the csv.
